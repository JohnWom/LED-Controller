# LED-Controller
 Neopixel LED Controller Complete Design Package

## Description
---
 This Github Repo stores the necessary code, technical drawings, and parts list needed to make a DIY Music-Reactive LED Controller. The key aspects of the design are the code, the 3D printed STL files and the GERBER custom PCB board. The main boards of the design are the Seeed XIAO RP2040 and the Arduino Nano 33 IoT. It is designed to work with WS2812B Leds (Neopixels) and is currently a work in progress. The code is written in C++ (Arduino code), and utilizes the Adafruit_Neopixel, DFRobot_LCD1602, and Fast_FFT libraries.
